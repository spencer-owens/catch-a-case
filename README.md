# Project Setup Guide

This repository contains a structured approach for building a new Vite + React application (code-named "AutoCRM"). It follows a series of documents that guide you through project context, user flows, technology stack choices, and best practices before outlining a phased approach to development.

## How @new-project-setup.md Works

The file [@new-project-setup.md](./docs/new-project-setup.md) provides a detailed sequence of steps and prompts, starting from a simple project overview and ending with a fully organized, phased approach to building the application. This file helps you:

1. Understand the overall goals and scope of the project (via the initial "Project Overview").  
2. Incrementally build supporting documents (user flow, tech stack decisions, UI/theme rules, etc.).  
3. Embody best practices in folder structure, coding style, checklist-based development, and environment setup.  
4. Follow a clearly defined, phase-by-phase plan for implementing each feature set in both frontend and backend contexts.

By reading and following each step in @new-project-setup.md, you'll quickly bootstrap a robust environment for AutoCRM, ensuring all participants or contributors operate with the same architectural understanding, coding guidelines, and clear objectives.
