# Phase 7: UI Polish & Comprehensive Testing

> Refines the user experience and adds thorough testing (unit, integration, e2e) based on @tech-stack-rules.md and @codebase-best-practices.md.

## Prerequisites
- Phase 6 completed (admin and team management)
- Basic UI already in place for each role

## Steps
1. [ ] FRONTEND: Review overall layout and styling (via Tailwind + Shadcn UI) to ensure minimalist, desktop-first approach  
2. [ ] FRONTEND: Add responsive breakpoints (sm, md, lg) for major pages (case detail, dashboards, admin pages)  
3. [ ] FRONTEND: Implement accessibility checks (aXe or similar) to identify any a11y issues (aria-labels, contrast, focus traps)  
4. [ ] TESTING: Write or finalize unit tests (Jest) for key components (forms, dashboard, messaging)  
5. [ ] TESTING: Implement integration tests (React Testing Library) for user flows (case creation, message exchange, attachments)  
6. [ ] TESTING: Set up end-to-end tests (Cypress) covering multi-step flows: register -> login -> create case -> add messages -> close case -> leave feedback  
7. [ ] FRONTEND: Drive consistency in toasts, error messages, or success confirmations across the app

## Success Criteria
- Polished UI that adheres to @theme-rules.md, is mostly bug-free, and gracefully handles multiple screen sizes  
- Unit, integration, and e2e test coverage meets or exceeds project standards (e.g., ~80% coverage)  
- Accessibility checks pass at a basic WCAG AA level  
- Any discovered defects are documented or fixed before final deployment

## Test Cases
- Happy path: All critical user journeys run seamlessly in Cypress with no UI or logic errors  
- Error/edge case: Verified that invalid forms or missing data produce user-friendly errors  
- Validation test: Accessibility tooling reveals no major issues (e.g., color contrast, keyboard accessibility)
