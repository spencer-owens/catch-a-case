# Phase 8: Deployment & Post-Release

> Final production deployment, environment setup, logging, and potential optimizations. References @important-considerations.md, @tech-stack.md, and @codebase-best-practices.md.

## Prerequisites
- Phase 7 completed (polished UI, comprehensive testing)
- Chosen deployment platforms (e.g., AWS Amplify, Railway, Netlify, Vercel) determined

## Steps
1. [ ] DEPLOYMENT: Configure environment variables for production (Supabase keys, service URLs)  
2. [ ] DEPLOYMENT: Set up hosting for the frontend (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) and backend or Supabase (for DB, Auth, etc.)  
3. [ ] DEPLOYMENT: Ensure secure credentials remain in secrets or environment config, not in the commit history  
4. [ ] BACKEND: Implement logging/monitoring (if not already) for error tracking (Sentry, Datadog, or custom logs)  
5. [ ] OPTIMIZATION: Review performance, load times, database indexing, and query usage; add or optimize indexes if needed  
6. [ ] QA: Run final checks in production-like environment—test user registration, case creation, messaging, attachments  
7. [ ] DOCUMENTATION: Update README with final deployment instructions, environment variable references, and known issues  
8. [ ] POST-RELEASE: Plan or implement any analytics/tracking (if required), gather user feedback for future iterations

## Success Criteria
- Production build is accessible via a domain or link and stable under typical usage  
- All environment variables are securely managed (no accidental leaks)  
- Monitoring/logging is in place to track errors or performance warnings  
- Documentation is thorough, enabling new team members to onboard quickly

## Test Cases
- Happy path: From a fresh environment, deploy + run the app with valid credentials, everything works as expected  
- Error/edge case: Production environment breaks if misconfigured env vars—logging steps can help identify root cause  
- Validation test: Minimal to zero downtime or error logs after going live
