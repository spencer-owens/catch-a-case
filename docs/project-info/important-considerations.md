# Important Considerations

This document outlines critical technical considerations and best practices for implementing the case management system.

## 1. Supabase Auth & Roles
• Authentication Implementation:  
  – Simple top-layer Auth system using Supabase Auth  
  – Basic role-based route protection using middleware  
  – Built-in session management via Supabase  

• Row Level Security:  
  – Simple policy rules based on user roles  
  – Basic data access patterns (own data, team data, all data)  
  – Automatic permission handling via Supabase RLS  

## 2. Real-Time Requirements
• Supabase Realtime:  
  – Real-time subscriptions  
  – Case updates  
  – Message delivery  
  – Status changes  

• Performance Optimization:  
  – Partial updates  
  – Incremental data sync  
  – Reduced full refetches  
  – Latency optimization  

## 3. Storage & File Handling
• Supabase Storage:  
  – Secure file storage  
  – Access control  
  – File organization  
  – Metadata management  

• File Management:  
  – Version control  
  – File replacement  
  – Cleanup procedures  
  – Storage optimization  

## 4. State Management
• Frontend State:  
  – React state management  
  – Local caching  
  – Global state patterns  
  – State synchronization  

• Data Consistency:  
  – Optimistic updates  
  – Error handling  
  – State recovery  
  – Cache invalidation  

## 5. Database Schema & Naming
• Naming Conventions:  
  – Consistent table names  
  – Field naming patterns  
  – Index naming  
  – Foreign key conventions  

• Schema Design:  
  – Efficient relationships  
  – Clear primary keys  
  – Proper indexing  
  – Query optimization  

## 6. Modularity & Reusability
• Code Organization:  
  – Modular components  
  – Reusable utilities  
  – Shared interfaces  
  – Common patterns  

• Best Practices:  
  – TypeScript standards  
  – Node.js patterns  
  – React conventions  
  – Code maintainability  

## 7. Testing Strategy
• Test Types:  
  – Unit tests  
  – Integration tests  
  – E2E testing  
  – Performance testing  

• Coverage:  
  – Critical paths  
  – Edge cases  
  – Error scenarios  
  – Security testing
